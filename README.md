## Getting Started
1. Install NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/ using the (.msi) installer and restart your computer if needed.
2. Test your installation with the following commands:
        
        node -v
        npm -v
        

3. In the command prompt, `cd` to your working directory, `git clone` the repository (if you don't have the GIT command-line tool installed, you can install it from https://git-scm.com/download/win) and then `cd` into the repository, e.g.

        cd C:\Users\Malek\School\Winter\SOEN341
        git clone https://github.com/AbdelmalekIhdene/shopalot.git
        cd shopalot

4. In the working directory, initially run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies, you should now have a `node_modules` folder.
5. Finally, run `npm start` to start the app in development mode and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view it.
